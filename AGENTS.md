When working in js/ts:

- when adding a package to a project add it with an install command, instead of manually editing the package json
- run check/format/lint commands when your done making a change. if they don't exist, suggest making them for the project you're in
- avoid explicit return types unless absolutely needed
- `as any` should be an absolute last resort. always use real type safety. lean on type inference instead of manually writing new types over and over again
- do not start or run any dev server, unless you kill them once you're done

When working in svelte(kit):

- use modern svelte practices, reference the svelte best practicies skill when writing .svelte file code

In general:

- when asking questions, ask them one at a time
